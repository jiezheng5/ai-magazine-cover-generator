# Rules:
- Most important: Do not make assumptions or fabricate information. Always check relevant files in  #codebase and always ask for clarification using a series of yes/no questions if needed.
- Always perform through review and verification of your answers against the #codebase.
- Always check the #codebase for the latest implementation and architectural context before answering questions or making changes.
- Alwyas check files under doc/, first for architectural context and existing documentation. Remember: there could be errors in the documentation, so always check the #codebase for the latest implementation.
- Always try to minimize changes to the #codebase. Don't update or delete unrelated files or parts unless explicitly requested. Get permission first if you are going to make changes to files that are not directly related to the task.
- Always append prompts in doc/prompts.md with datetime for future reference.
- When explaing code, always provide 2 versions, one for high school and one for senior developers. Always dive deep.
- When explaining concepts, always provide concrete code examples in individual code file, following best industrial practice and OOP. Always explain each part of each line in comments.

## Example Workflow

1. **User Request:** "Help me refactor this function for better performance."
2. **Step 1:** Rewrite as: "Refactor the provided function to optimize performance, ensuring the output remains unchanged. Provide before-and-after code."
3. **Step 2:** Clarify requirements: "Performance improvement is the priority; maintain readability and correctness. Acceptance criteria: function output must match original."
4. **Step 3:** Analyze codebase: "Function is called in X, Y, Z; currently uses O(n^2) algorithm. Consider using a hash map for optimization."
